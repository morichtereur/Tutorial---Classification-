**Mushroom Classification**

This project aims at developing a machine-learning algorithm that will determine if a certain mushroom is edible or poisonous by its specifications like cap shape, cap color, gill color, etc. using different classifiers.

**Notebook 1:**
We will try to classify these mushrooms as poisonous or edible using (Perfect classifier)
- **Logistic regression**
- **Linear discriminant analysis (LQA)**
- **Quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA)**

**Notebook 2:**
In the second project, I will examine the data and create a machine learning algorithm that will detect if the mushroom is edible or poisonous by its specifications like cap shape, cap color, gill color, etc. using different classifiers.
- **Logistic regression**
- **Linear discriminant analysis (LQA)**
- **Quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA)**
- **KNN Classification (KNN)**
- **Naive Bayes Classification (NB)**
