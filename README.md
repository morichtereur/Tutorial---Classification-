**Mushroom Classification**

This project aims at developing a machine-learning algorithm that will determine if a certain mushroom is edible or poisonous by its specifications like cap shape, cap color, gill color, etc. using different classifiers.

We will try to classify these mushrooms as poisonous or edible using

Notebook 1:
- **Logistic regression**
- **Linear discriminant analysis (LQA)**
- **Quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA)**

Notebook 2:
- **Logistic regression**
- **Linear discriminant analysis (LQA)**
- **Quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA)**
- **KNN Classification (KNN)**
- **Naive Bayes Classification (NB)**
